USER STORY:
- WHEN USER wants to schedule tasks that need to be completed over the course of the day
- THEN USER can enter tasks enter tasks for each hour of the workday 
- WHEN USER wants to save tasks for later viewing
- THEN USER can click the save button for the corresponding hour and tasks are saved in local storage
- WHEN USER navigates away the site and then returns
- THEN saved tasks are retrieved from local storage and displayed
- WHEN USER wants to see which tasks are due during the current hour or are comping
- THEN USER can see the current hour styled with a red background and future are are styled with a green background

Future Development Goals:
- Add a "notes" text area input that can be saved and is not tied to a specific time
- Add ability to navigate to different days schedule/save tasks for that day
